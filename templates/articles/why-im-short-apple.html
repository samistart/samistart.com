<p>The first questions we must answer are "how does Apple currently make money?" and "how do analysts expect Apple to make money in the future?".</p>

<p>63% of Apple revenue comes from the iPhone series. I have a neutral outlook on the Mac, Apple Watch and Apple TV series so I will assume that the market has priced them fairly. I have a negative view on the iPad’s competitiveness in the tablet space for the same reasons as the iPhone and a negative view on the tablet market in general. iPad sales are highly correlated with the success of the iPhone due to the synergies between tablet and phone running on the same operating system. The iPad also accounts for only 9% of revenue so it's best to focus on the iPhone.</p>

<p>Analyst consensus for growth over the next 5 years is <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/analysts?ltr=1">8.7% per annum</a>. This prices in a combination of a growth in existing product lines, and the expectancy value of Apple releasing the ‘next big thing’. In the next two sections I will unravel why we can expect decay in profits in existing product lines and why Apple is not poised to come up with the ‘next big thing’.</p>

<h3>Decay of existing revenue streams</h3>

<p>The iPhone is losing product differentiation and can no longer expect to enjoy the well-deserved monopoly of years past.</p>

<p>So far we have seen two paradigms in mobile phones:</p>

<p>Mobile phones running an operating system capable of communicating over mobile networks. Nokia released the 3310 in the year 2000, when Nokia's market share reached an all-time high. BlackBerry released the Curve in 2007, which was one of the devices that bridged the way to internet-based services. RIM (makers of Blackberry) held a <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/263439/global-market-share-held-by-rim-smartphones/">20.9%</a> share of the smartphone OS market, second to Symbian (the OS for Nokia) in 2007.</p>
<p>The smartphone. The most revolutionary thing about smartphones is that they allowed third-party developers to vend content after the sale of the physical device. The advent of cellular networks with bandwidth capable of loading rich webpages and streaming media paved the way to apps as we now know them. Apple started selling more phones than Research In Motion (Blackberry) in <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/266219/global-smartphone-sales-since-1st-quarter-2009-by-operating-system/">Q3 2010</a>, at the time of release of the iPhone 4</p>

<p>After the peak of each of these reigns, early adopters moved slowly away from the brand in question, the market hit a tipping point and then the market moved away all at once. Each paradigm saw jostling for market share such as RIM vs. Symbian and iOS vs. Android. However, the turn of the paradigm of smartphones created a binary step in the market that took Nokia and RIM out of the business that they enjoyed before. We're entering a new mobile phone paradigm of artificial intelligence that will be mostly outsourced to the cloud and play into the software skills of Google, rather than the hardware and user experience skills of Apple.</p>

The mobile phone consists of components that are mature in nature: the battery - Apple has recently secured <a href="http://www.patentlyapple.com/patently-apple/2015/11/apple-granted-a-patent-for-solid-state-battery-technology-for-portable-devices-and-beyond.html">a patent for a solid-state battery technology</a> and seems to be <a href="https://jobs.apple.com/us/search#specs&ss=Cell%20Design%20Development%20Manager&t=0&so=&lo=0*USA&pN=0">hiring material engineers aggressively</a> for battery R&D based on their job listings. It's also likely that research for their electric cars would have synergy with batteries for portable devices. Smartphone displays are approaching affordable 4k OLED displays, suggesting a mature field with little room for improvement beyond the resolution of the human eye. Samsung, Google and Facebook (having acquired Oculus VR) are leading the way into the VR space. Apple has little advantage with the power of the chip as Moore’s law is the same as everyone else. The iPhone used to be the only smartphone that had integrated hardware and software by the same company but now Google has caught up with the <a href="https://madeby.google.com/phone/">Pixel</a>. The hardware design of the smartphone has been tending towards a final form and the striking similarity of the iPhone 7 to the previous generation indicates that we have arrived at the plateau. Application software is the least mature out of all of these components and has the most room for growth. Innovations in software are likely to be where the ‘next big thing’ comes from.

<p>Apple no longer has any product differentiation in any of these areas. With a lack of product differentiation we tend towards perfects competition and hence profit margins that are a shadow of the fantastic and well-deserved monopoly that Apple has enjoyed since 2010. Brand loyalty has an expiration date, which is fast-approaching for Apple.</p>

<h3>The probability of Apple coming up with ‘the next big thing’ is lower than is priced in</h3>

<p>The age of hardware is over and we are hearing buzzwords such as artificial intelligence, wearables, virtual reality, autonomous vehicles, biometrics and IoT.</p>

<p>Apple has aggressively ramped up it’s spending on R&D with $10B invested in 2015. Elon Musk described Apple’s desire to move into the electric car industry as an ‘open secret’.  Neil Cybart <a href="http://www.aboveavalon.com/about/">suggests</a> that Apple intends to pivot into autonomous vehicles and wearables (led by the Apple Watch).  Whilst these are promising markets, Apple is not the only player in the race. Google has already showcased its self-driving cars and Elon Musk has pledged that by the end of 2017, Tesla will produce a vehicle that can drive itself from Los Angeles to New York City autonomously. </p>

<p>The current smartwatch is already functionally more than good enough, with sleek designs, all-day batteries, heart rate and GPS sensors and high-quality touch-displays from both the Apple Watch and Android Wear. The real challenge will now be building software that gives a compelling reason to buy a smartwatch. The smartwatch market is necessarily smaller than that of the smartphone due to the synergies between the two devices.</p>

<p>Artificial intelligence is the most powerful and exponentially growing of the approaching technologies, and will run the software for all of the aforementioned. Google is poised to dominate AI and it will serve its powerful software from hardware design that is effortlessly and blatantly copied from Apple, such as the <a href="https://madeby.google.com/phone/">Pixel</a>. The hardware becomes almost trivial when you consider that your OS will be able to leverage artificial intelligence in the cloud to drive your schedule, media, work, dating, and health.</p>

<p>Investors, science fiction authors and laymen alike, underestimate the progress of technology time and time again due to the law of accelerating returns and the exponential growth of technology. The next big thing is coming sooner than you think and it’s not just going to decay the 8.7% 5-year growth forecast for Apple - it's going to totally disrupt it.</p>
